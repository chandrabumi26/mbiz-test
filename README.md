# Getting Started with React and TypeScript

This project is bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) with TypeScript.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn preview`

Preview the production build.\
After running `yarn build`, you can run this command to preview the app locally.

### `yarn typecheck`

Runs TypeScript type checking.\
Ensure your code is type-safe by running this command.
